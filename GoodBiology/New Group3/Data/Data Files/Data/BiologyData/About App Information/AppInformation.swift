    If you will soon have a biology test, and you want to prepare for it very quickly and conveniently, or you just want to interest your friends with your mind your exact choice is Good Biology. I’m (The Developer) still talking about convenience and haven’t given any examples, so let me list the main functions of my application:

    1) The origin of any information from the Wikipedia service and other books (related to biology). Information from services and books is usually clear to everyone, simple and contains only the main information that is needed most.

    2) In our application, many functions that can distract or interfere with reading. Therefore, you can simply brush away the top as there will be only text that you can already read as a book.

    3) If you have poor eyesight or you simply do not see the text, you can easily correct it by clicking on the plus or minus button.

    4) In the application is a lot of information and read all at once will be quite difficult, so we have a special text editor in which there are all the functions to quickly create a note for today or another time.

    5) There is a lot of information in the application but it will not always be easy to find the one you need, for this a special Internet browser is built into the program. It has the most basic functions for convenient surfing the net.

    6) After you confidently read all the information that is in the application or in our browser, the program has prepared for you interesting tests where you confidently check your knowledge.

    7) Reading is good, and reading in the most beloved places is even better. Therefore, maps are built into the application where you can mark your favorite places to read as well as find them.
