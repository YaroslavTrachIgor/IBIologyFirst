    static let basicsBasics = "Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes,  molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution. Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying  concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field. Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of   heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species. Living organisms are open systems that survive by    transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy to maintain a stable and vital condition defined as homeostasis."
    
    
    static let historyBasics = "The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology or the doctrine of life.Although modern   biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was    studied as early as the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China."
    
    
    static let history2Basics = "The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these     phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name     biology or the doctrine of life. Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been   studied since ancient times."
    
    
    static let cellBasics = "Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all  cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a  single cell in a fertilized egg."
    
    
    static let evolutionBasics = "A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a    common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an     ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.5 billion years ago."
    
    
    static let geneticsBasics = "Genes are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that     influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways."
    
    
    static let structularBasics = "Molecular biology is the study of biology at the molecular level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated."
