    var firstPage_FirstAnswer: String = "All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification may date from Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC), who made the distincton between plants, which generally do not move, and animals, which often are mobile to catch their food. Much later, when Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of the modern system of scientific classification, these two groups became the kingdoms Vegetabilia"
    var firstPage_SecondAnswer: String = "The table below shows some species count estimates of different green plant (Viridiplantae) divisions. It suggests there are about 700,000 species of living Viridiplantae, of which 85–60% are flowering plants. Note: as these are from different sources and different dates, they are not necessarily comparable"
    
    // Second Page
    var secondPage_FirstAnswer =
    """
Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Micrbes. They form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "red plants") that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses and the green algae, and excludes the red and yellow algae.
"""
    var secondPage_SecondAnswer = "Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and may lose the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize. "
    
    // Third Page
    var thirdPage_FirstAnswer = "These groups also differ from green plants in that the storage polysaccharide is floridean starch and is stored in the cytoplasm rather than in the plastids. They appear to have had a common origin with Viridiplantae and the three groups form the clade Archaeplastida, whose name implies that their chloroplasts were derived from a single ancient endosymbiotic event. This is the broadest modern definition of the term 'plant'."
    var thirdPage_SecondAnswer = "Linnaeus' original classification placed the fungi within the Plantae, since they were unquestionably neither animals or minerals and these were the only other alternatives. With 18th century developments in microbiology, Erneste Haeckel introduced the new kingdom Protista in addition to Plantae and Archaea."
