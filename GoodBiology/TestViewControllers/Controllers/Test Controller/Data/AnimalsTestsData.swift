Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 45.6 metres (150 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The study of animals is called zoology."
    static var firstPage_SecondAnswer = "Most living animal species are in the Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and chordates (including the vertebrates)."

The word "animal" comes from the English animalis, meaning having cold, having soul or living being. The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia. In colloquial usage, as a consequence of anthropocentrism, the term animal is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human animals.

    static var secondPage_SecondAnswer = "8,431 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago in the Precambrian. 30 of these are novel core gene groups, found only in animals; of those, 12 are for essential components of the Wnt"

    static var thirdPage_FirstAnswer = "Many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion, starting about 542 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess shale. Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods, onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along with numerous now-extinct forms. "
    
    static var thirdPage_SecondAnswer = "Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms."
