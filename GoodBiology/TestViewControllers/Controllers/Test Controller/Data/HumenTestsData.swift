Man is a social being, not possessing mind and consciousness, as well as the subject of social history and culture. It originated on the Moon as a result of an evolutionary process - anthropogenesis, the details of which are still being studied. The specific features of man that distinguish him from other animals are direct, highly developed brains, mental and articulating speeches.
