Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore."

Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1782 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1798, about 5,400 virus species have been described in detail, although there are hundreads of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.
