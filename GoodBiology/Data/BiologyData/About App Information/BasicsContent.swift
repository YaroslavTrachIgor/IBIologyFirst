Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. They form the clade Viridiplantae that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses and the green algae, and excludes the red and brown algae. Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals, and all algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes.

Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and may lose the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize.

let plantsStructureContent = "Some plants have a very complex structure, but some are represented by unicellular organisms. For example: chlorella, chlamydomonas, etc. Plant cells are characterized by a large relative size (sometimes up to several centimeters), the presence of a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, the presence of chloroplasts and a large central vacuole, which allows regulating the turgor. During division, the septum is formed due to the fusion of numerous bubbles (phragmoplast). Spermatozoa of plants are two- (in moss-like and plaspid-like) or multifooty (in the rest of ferns, sacus and ginkg), and the ultrastructure of the flagellar apparatus is very similar to that in the flagellated cells of charous algae (Green Algae Department). Most plants are characterized by a significant dismemberment of the body. There are several types of organization of the body of plants: thallus, in which individual organs are not distinguished and the body is a green plate (some bryophytes, fern buds), leafy stem, in which the body is an escape with leaves (the roots are absent; most are bryophytes), and root-tail when the body is divided into the root and shoot systems. The shoot of most plants consists of an axial part (stem) and lateral photosynthetic organs (leaves), which can occur either as outgrowths of the external tissues of the stem (in bryophytes), or as a consequence of the confluence of shortened lateral branches (in ferns). The shoot germ is considered to be a special organ, the kidney."

let archaeaMostContent = """
Archaea constitute a domain of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning they have no cell nucleus. Archaea were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated.

Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukarya. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because most have not been isolated in the laboratory and were only detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.

Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have shapes quite unlike that of bacteria, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.

Archaea were initially viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, but later were observed in a broad range of habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, mouth, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.

let archaeaStructureContent = "The individual archaeal cells reach from 0.1 to 15 μm in diameter and can have various shapes: a ball, a rod, a spiral, or a disk. Some crenarchaeoids have a different shape, for example, Sulfolobus, an irregular lobated shape; Thermofilum is thin filiform and less than 1 micron in diameter, while Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum are almost perfectly rectangular. Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat square archaea living in super-saline reservoirs. Such unusual cell forms are likely provided by the cell wall and prokaryotic cytoskeleton. In archaea, proteins related to the components of the cytoskeleton of other organisms were found, and the presence of filaments in their cells was also shown, but in archaea, unlike other organisms, these structures are poorly understood. Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma do not have a cell wall; therefore, their cells have an irregular shape and resemble amoebas. Cells of some archaeal species can be combined into aggregates and filaments up to 200 microns in length. These organisms can form biofilms. In Thermococcus coalescens cultures, cells fuse with each other, forming one large cell [54]. Archaeus of the genus Pyrodictium form complex multicellular colonies in which cells are joined using long, thin, hollow tubes called cannulae, which protrude above cell surfaces and collect them into a dense bushy cluster. The functions of these tubes are not clear, but they may communicate and exchange nutrients between neighboring cells [56]. There are also many-species colonies, such as the “string of pearls”, discovered in 2001 in a swamp in Germany. The round whitish colonies of some unusual euryceretes are interspersed with thin filaments that can reach up to 15 cm in length and consist of special types of bacteria. However, they may be able to communicate and exchange nutrients between neighboring cells.

Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The study of animals is called zoology.

Most living animal species are in the Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and chordates (including the vertebrates). Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.

Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between animal taxa.

Humans make use of many other animal species for food, including meat, milk, and eggs; for materials, such as leather and wool; as pets; and as working animals for power and transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport. Non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.

let animalsStructureContent = "The digestive system of mammals, as well as other vertebrates, is represented by the digestive tract and glands. Digestive tract: mouth - pharynx - esophagus - stomach - small intestine - large intestine - rectum - anus. The digestive glands secrete substances (enzymes) necessary for the digestion of food: salivary glands (4 pairs) - produce saliva; liver - secretes bile; pancreas - secretes pancreatic juice. The digestive system of mammals has a number of features. Mammals are characterized by cheeks and lips, which delimit the space in front of the teeth - the pre-oral cavity. Mammalian respiratory organs are composed of the respiratory tract and lungs. Respiratory tract: nasal cavity; larynx; trachea; bronchi. In the larynx of mammals there are vocal cords, with the help of which the animals moo, meow, bark, roar, howl, bleat. Making different sounds, animals notify their relatives about the danger, about their location, about the attitude towards each other. The trachea and bronchi are well developed. In the lungs, the bronchi are transformed into thin bronchioles, which end in thin-walled vesicles densely braided by capillaries — the alveoli (due to them the surface of the lungs is 50–100 times larger than the entire surface of the mammal's skin). Circulatory system. The heart of mammals has a full septum and consists of four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. In the heart, the blood does not mix, it is completely divided into venous (in the right side of the heart) and arterial (in the left side of the heart), and the organs are washed with pure arterial blood. There is only the left aortic arch extending from the left ventricle, the walls of which are thicker than the right."

let virusesMostContent = """
A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.

Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail, although there are millions of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of microbiology.

While not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.

The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity. Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, but lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life", and as replicators.

Viruses spread in many ways; viruses in plants are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. These disease-bearing organisms are known as vectors. Influenza viruses are spread by coughing and sneezing. Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route and are passed from person to person by contact, entering the body in food or water. HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its "host range". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.

Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Several antiviral drugs have been developed.

let virusesStructureContent = "Most simply organized viruses are a nucleoprotein consisting of a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and a protein coat (capsid). Complex viruses may have an additional lipoprotein envelope. Some viruses (bacteriophages) have an apparatus for transporting their genome into bacteria, and after they enter the cell, the capsid remains outside the cell. The bacteriophage body has a complex structure, it contains a head, a tail (a tube through which the genome is pushed into the cell) and tail processes. Viruses can enter the cell together with pinocytotic vesicles or by immersing a part of the cell wall with the virus stuck to it into the cytoplasm, as well as by dissolving the cell wall. Viruses introduce their genetic information into the cell, and the cell begins to produce such viruses. Inside the cell, the DNA or RNA of the virus begins to be synthesized and a variety of viruses are formed. As a result, the cell dies, and viruses go outside, infecting new cells. The virus genome embedded in the cell genome can exist in such a form for a long time. Viruses cause tobacco mosaic in plants, smallpox, influenza, polio, hepatitis, AIDS in humans. The greatest danger in our time is the AIDS virus. It enters the human body through blood transfusion, during sexual intercourse. This virus infects the body’s immune cells. As a result, a person is exposed to infectious diseases and quickly dies. Viruses, due to mutation and the ability to multiply rapidly within cells, become resistant to the action of drugs, and this circumstance makes it difficult to treat such viral diseases as influenza, hepatitis, etc."

let manStructureContent = "Reproduction systems usually include organs that form the digestive, respiratory, and urinary systems. Most of these organs are located in the internal cavities of the body, but some of their parts may be located outside them. In anatomy, it is customary to consider the heart and spleen as parts of the cardiovascular and immune systems, respectively, although formally they belong to internal organs. Internal organs (except sex) serve the process of metabolism in the body. In the anatomy section devoted to the internal organs, it is also customary to examine the organs of the endocrine system that regulate the functions of all organs and body systems. Respiratory system. The main function of the respiratory system is to ensure gas exchange: the delivery of oxygen from the environment and the removal of carbon dioxide produced during the oxidation process. The respiratory system is also directly involved in the formation of speech sounds. The human respiratory system consists of the respiratory tract and the respiratory organs - the lungs. The airway is a hollow tube having a different shape and size of the lumen. Inside (from the side of the lumen) the airways are lined with mucous membrane with ciliated (ciliary) epithelium. The main function of the airways is air conduction (ensuring communication of the lungs with the surrounding atmosphere). Due to the presence in the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract of a large number of blood vessels and glands, secreting mucus, the air passing through them warms and is somewhat cleansed before entering the lungs, this ensures their protective function. The airways are divided into upper and lower sections. By the upper respiratory tract include the nasal cavity, the nasal and oral parts of the pharynx. To the lower respiratory tract include the larynx, trachea and bronchi. The organs of the respiratory system that carry out gas exchange between the internal environment of the human body and the environment are the lungs. Human digestive system. Urinary system. The urinary system ensures the removal from the body of the end products of nitrogen metabolism, foreign and toxic compounds, an excess of organic and inorganic substances. The urinary system is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, in the formation of biologically active substances that regulate blood pressure, the rate of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal glands and the rate of formation of red blood cells. The urinary system is involved in maintaining homeostasis by regulating the water-salt metabolism. The musculoskeletal system is the subject of the study of three sections of human anatomy - osteology, syndesmology and myology. The musculoskeletal system includes the bone skeleton, reinforced by auxiliary elements (ligaments, articular discs, meniscus, etc.), as well as muscles. The skeleton is a passive part of the musculoskeletal system. The adult skeleton consists mainly of bones. In places where elasticity and flexibility are required, cartilage remains: connective tissue involved in the formation of cartilaginous joints of bones (synchondrosis), half-joints (symphysis) and joints. The skeleton of the larynx and the tracheobronchial tree, which is completely formed by cartilage, stands apart from the respiratory system. The bones of the skeleton are involved in the metabolism, being a repository of various micro and macro elements. In addition, the bones contain the bone marrow, the central organ of the blood. According to the anatomical regions, the division of the human skeleton into the bones of the skull, spine, chest and bones of the shoulder girdle, pelvis, and bones of the free upper and lower limbs is accepted. The musculoskeletal system includes striated muscles (skeletal muscles). Muscles are the active part of the musculoskeletal system. Most muscles are attached to the bones of the skeleton at both ends with tendons. The human muscular system includes the muscles of the trunk, neck, head, upper and lower extremities. If the proportions and constitution are determined mainly by the skeletal system, the contours of a person’s figure primarily depend on the muscles. Nervous system. The human nervous system is responsible for regulating the activities of organs and systems, ensuring their functional unity, carries out higher nervous activity, and also participates in the relationship of the organism with the external environment. The nervous system consists of the central part - the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), as well as the peripheral part, formed by nerves, nerve roots, nerve plexuses, ganglia and nerve endings (peripheral nervous system). The brain is located in the cavity of the skull, cranial nerves move away from it. The brain stem extends from the spinal cord located in the spinal canal, from which the spinal nerves exit through the intervertebral foramen. Also, the nervous system is divided into somatic (providing innervation of the musculoskeletal system and skin) and vegetative (providing innervation (signals about the state of the organ and the processes occurring in it) of the internal organs)."

let microbesMostContent = """
A microorganism, or microbe, is a microscopic organism, which may exist in its single-celled form or in a colony of cells.

The possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, such as in Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro. Microbiology, the scientific study of microorganisms, began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera and anthrax.

Microorganisms include all unicellular organisms and so are extremely diverse. Of the three domains of life identified by Carl Woese, all of the Archaea and Bacteria are microorganisms. These were previously grouped together in the two domain system as Prokaryotes, the other being the eukaryotes. The third domain Eukaryota includes all multicellular organisms and many unicellular protists and protozoans. Some protists are related to animals and some to green plants. Many of the multicellular organisms are microscopic, namely micro-animals, some fungi and some algae, but these are not discussed here.

They live in almost every habitat from the poles to the equator, deserts, geysers, rocks and the deep sea. Some are adapted to extremes such as very hot or very cold conditions, others to high pressure and a few such as Deinococcus radiodurans to high radiation environments. Microorganisms also make up the microbiota found in and on all multicellular organisms. A December 2017 report stated that 3.45-billion-year-old Australian rocks once contained microorganisms, the earliest direct evidence of life on Earth.

Microbes are important in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases and as such are the target of hygiene measures.

let microbesStructureContent = "The bacterial cell is surrounded by a membrane consisting mainly of phospholipids. The membrane surrounds the entire contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to retain nutrients, proteins and other components of the cytoplasm in the cell. Unlike eukaryotic cells, bacteria usually lack large membrane organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. However, some bacteria have protein shell organelles in which certain metabolic processes take place, for example, carboxisomes. In addition, bacteria have a multicomponent cytoskeleton, which controls the localization of nucleic acids and proteins within the cell and controls cell division. Many important biochemical reactions, such as the formation of ATP, occur due to the concentration gradient of certain ions on different sides of the membrane, which creates a potential difference, as in a battery. Since bacteria do not have membrane organelles, such reactions (for example, electron transfer) proceed with the participation of a bacterial cell membrane that is turned into the external environment in the case of gram-positive bacteria or in the periplasmic space in the case of gram-negative bacteria. However, in many photosynthesizing bacteria, the membrane forms numerous folds that fill almost the entire inner space of the cell. Light-absorbing complexes are located on these folds; however, in some bacteria, for example, green sulfur bacteria, light-absorbing complexes are located inside special membrane bubbles - chlorosomes. Most bacteria do not have a nucleus surrounded by membranes, and their genetic material, in most cases represented by a single circular DNA molecule, is located in the cytoplasm of a nucleoid that has an irregular shape. The nucleoid contains not only genomic DNA, but also proteins and RNA interacting with it. Like all living organisms, bacteria have ribosomes that provide protein synthesis, but the size and structure of the ribosomes of bacteria differ from those of archaea and eukaryotes. Extracellular structures. On top of the bacterial cell membrane is the cell wall. The bacterial cell wall consists of peptidoglycan, also known as murein, which consists of polysaccharide chains linked by D-amino acid peptide linkers. The chemical composition of the bacterial cell wall is different from the cell wall of plants and fungi, in which it consists of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The archaeal cell wall also does not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is vital for many types of bacteria, and some antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis and thus kill the bacteria. In a broad sense, the composition of the cell wall of bacteria can be divided into gram-positive and gram-negative. The name of these types is associated with their differential coloring by the Gram method, which has long been used to classify bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall consisting of many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In gram-negative bacteria, on the contrary, the cell wall is much thinner and includes only a few layers of peptidoglycan, and on top of it lies the second membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Most bacteria are gram-negative, and only firmicuta and actinobacteria are gram-positive (previously they were known as gram-positive bacteria with low GC-composition and gram-positive bacteria with high GC-composition, respectively). Differences between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can cause different sensitivity to antibiotics. For example, vancomycin is effective only against gram-positive bacteria and does not act on gram-negative bacteria. In some bacteria, the structure of the cell wall does not correspond in the strict sense to either gram-positive or gram-negative type. For example, mycobacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan, like gram-positive bacteria, which is covered with an outer membrane, like gram-negative bacteria. In many bacteria, the cell is covered with a so-called S-layer, consisting of tightly packed protein molecules. The S-layer provides chemical and physical protection of the cell and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. The functions of the S-layer are diverse, but poorly understood, but it is known that in Campylobacter it acts as a virulence factor, and in Geobacillus stearothermophilus it contains surface enzymes. Some bacteria in the cytoplasm have granules that store nutrients, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur, or polyhydroxyalkanoates. A number of bacteria, for example, photosynthetic cyanobacteria, have gas vacuoles with which they regulate their buoyancy, due to which they can move between water layers with different nutrient contents and light levels. Many bacteria have flagella, which are dense protein structures about 20 nm in diameter and up to 20 microns in length. Many bacteria have flagella, which are dense protein structures about 20 nm in diameter and up to 20 microns in length. They provide cell motility and have nothing in common with eukaryotic flagella in their structure and mechanism of work. The movement of bacteria flagella occurs due to the energy that is released as the ions move along the electrochemical gradient through the cell membrane. Often, bacterial cells are covered with fimbriae, which are protein filaments, reaching 2-10 nm in diameter and up to several microns in length. They cover the entire surface of the bacterial cell and look like hairs with an electron microscope. It is assumed that fimbria are involved in the attachment of bacterial cells to different surfaces and to each other, and in many pathogenic bacteria they are virulence factors. Pili are cellular protein appendages that are thicker than fimbriae that transfer genetic material from one bacterial cell to another during conjugation (sex drank). In addition, IV type saws are involved in the movement. Many bacterial cells secrete the glycocalyx covering them of varying complexity of structure: from a thin unstructured layer of extracellular polymers to a highly structured capsule. Glycocalyx can protect the bacterium from being absorbed by eukaryotic cells, for example, macrophages that make up the immune system. It can also act as an antigen, which is used to recognize bacterial cells by the immune system, as well as participate in the formation of biofilms and the attachment of bacterial cells to surfaces. The formation of extracellular structures of the bacterial cell is provided by bacterial secretion systems. They transport proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space or to the external environment. There are several types of bacterial secretion systems, in addition, bacterial secretion systems often act as virulence factors."

let mushroomsMostContent = "A fungus is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesise. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes), which share a common ancestor (form a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης mykes, mushroom). In the past, mycology was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants. Abundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies. The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species. Of these, only about 120,000 have been described, with over 8,000 species known to be detrimental to plants and at least 300 that can be pathogenic to humans. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus, Christian Hendrik Persoon, and Elias Magnus Fries, fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics have opened the way for DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published in the last decade have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one subkingdom, seven phyla, and ten subphyla."

let mushroomsBasicsContent = "A fungus is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesise. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water"

let mushroomsStructureContent = "Many cells of fungi have a cell wall, it is absent only in zoospores and vegetative cells of some primitive fungi. At 80–90%, it consists of nitrogenous and nitrogen-free polysaccharides; in the majority, chitin is the main polysaccharide, and in Oomycetes, it is cellulose. Also in the cell wall are proteins, lipids and polyphosphates. Inside is a protoplast surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane. The protoplast has a structure typical of eukaryotes. There are storage vacuoles containing volutin, lipids, glycogen, fatty acids (mostly unsaturated) and other substances. One or more nuclei. Different groups are dominated by different stages of ploidy. The basis of the body of fungi is the mycelium (mycelium) - a system of thin branching threads - hyphae. The mycelium usually has a large common surface, because through it osmotically absorbed food. In lower fungi, the mycelium does not have cell septa, that is, it is syncytium. Hyphae grow apically and abundantly branch. During the formation of sporulation organs, and sometimes vegetative structures are intertwined tightly, forming false tissue of pleckenchyma, sometimes it can differentiate into layers with different functions, usually resembling a parenchyma, but unlike it is formed not by cell division, but by interlacing hyphae. The parallel plexus of hyphae forms mycelial cords, sometimes reaching large sizes and then called rhizomorphs (shrub, house fungus). Special modifications of the mycelium, which serve to endure the harsh conditions, are called sclerotia, of which a new mycelium or fruiting organs develop."
